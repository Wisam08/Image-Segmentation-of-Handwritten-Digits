# Image-Segmentation-of-Handwritten-Digits

### Project Overview

This project focuses on segmenting handwritten digits using deep learning techniques. The primary goal is to preprocess handwritten digit images, train a neural network to recognize and segment them, and evaluate the model's performance.

### Features
<ul>
  <li>Data preprocessing and augmentation for robust training.  </li>

<li>Implementation of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for segmentation.  </li>

<li>Visualization of predictions and evaluation metrics.  </li>

 <li>Modular and reusable code for experimentation.
  </li>
</ul>






### Dataset

The project uses a handwritten digit dataset. Ensure the dataset is available in the appropriate directory before running the notebook. The dataset should include:
<ul>
  <li>Input images of handwritten digits
</li>
  <li>Corresponding segmentation labels</li>
</ul>



### Key Sections in the Notebook
<ul>
  <li>Data Loading and Preprocessing: Reads and preprocesses the dataset.</li>
  <li>Model Definition: Defines the CNN architecture.</li>
  <li>Training: Trains the model and monitors performance.
</li>
  <li>Evaluation and Visualization: Evaluates the model and visualizes the results.
</li>
</ul>






### Results

The project achieves satisfactory segmentation performance with metrics such as accuracy and Intersection over Union (IoU). Detailed results are available in the notebook's output section.

### Future Work
<ul>
  <li>Explore advanced segmentation architectures such as U-Net and Mask R-CNN.
</li>
  <li>Experiment with transfer learning to improve performance.
</li>
  <li>Test on additional handwritten datasets for generalization.</li>
</ul>
